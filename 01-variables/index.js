//variable are like container where we can store values.


/*
we can change the variable type in run time.
 we can store NUMBER, ARRAY, OBJECT in the same variable, this is called dynamically typed language

 #->Dynamicaly typed language means we can the variable type in runtime.(example- javascript)

 #-> Static type -> we first declare the type of variable, wheather it is a intger, float, or string.


 let and const is better to use.
